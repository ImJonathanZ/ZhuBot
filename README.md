# ZhuBot

## A discord bot created for servers with friends
This bot is created as a fun project to create moderation, and incorporate cool and fun features into a discord. Punny name after my last name and the Pok√©mon Zubat.

## Commands:

- `/ping`
    - Returns the message latency and API latency of the bot
- `/purge <amount> <user>`
    - Deletes `<amount>` number of messages
    - `<amount>` - the number of messages to delete
    - `<user>` - optional, specifies a user to delete messages from. Note that this will only delete messages from user within `<amount>` number of messages. Not `<amount>` number of messages from user.
    - Usage: `/purge 5 John` 
        - Deletes the last messages that John sent within the last 5 messages
